Find the source code organised in tutorials 1 to 12 in the master branch of the repo and the description of the technique together with a step-by-step tutorial [here](https://www.spatialanalysisonline.com/An%20Introduction%20to%20Spatial%20Data%20Analysis%20in%20R.pdf).

Note: Popular packages ``rgdal`` and ``rgeos`` for spatial analysis in R were retired in October 2023. Recommended alternatives that have been used in this tutorial are ``sf`` and ``sp`` whose equivalent functions to the retired packages have been listed [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/06/upcoming-changes-to-popular-r-packages-for-spatial-data-what-you-need-to-do/).
